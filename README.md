# CS-230-Portfolio
Repository for my CS-230 8-2 Journal Portfolio

Throughout this term, we were given the task of designing a new web based gaming program for The Gaming Room. Our client has already had success with Android applications and wanted to expand into a web application. We needed to design a flexible application that can support multiple operating systems. 

I felt that throughout this design process the part that went well for me was understanding the requirements and being able to come up with a design that adhered to those requirements. I was able to go one by one and make sure that each requirement was thoroughly researched and I was able to come up with a well planned and thought out design that will meet the client's needs. Using a server based approach, we can deliver a program to meet the current needs and can later be iterated to meet any future needs. 

Having the UML diagrams set up for the application was extremely helpful. I was able to reference the UML diagram to see what connected to what and how the code should handle these relationships behind the scenes. Using the the UML diagram I was able to make concise design decisions that helped when writing the code. 

I think I did a good job at comparing the different operating systems and their benefits, but if I could re-do any section it would probably be that. I would like to do a little more research into each one and get a deeper understanding of each. I would like to learn more about linux and mac, since those are two of the operating systems that I have the least experience working with. 

User's are the backbone to any successful web application. The best web application in the world is nothing if no one is using it. User's wants and needs should be a driving factor throughout the entire design process. We should focus more of our attentions to parts of the application that will make a difference to the user, such as speed, accessability. It's easier to make improvements to things like the appearence later down the line, and may not be as important to retaining a user. In most cases a user can deal with an applcation that it not the prettiest visually, but if the application is sluggish or crashes often you are much more likely to lose that user. 

I started with the requirements and making sure I had a full understanding of what needed to be accomplished. I think this is the best approach. If you don't understand the "needs" how can you give the best design possible? The client had a specific list of requirements and I had to make sure we could deliver those, everything else is secondary.
